created a main branch
added project file (content -- "Hello from main")
commit
created a feature1 branch to main
modified project file(content -- "Hello from feature1")
commit
created other branch to main i.e., feature2
modified project fil(content -- "Hello from feature")
now if i go to feature1 and try to merge feature2 in it
i got merge conflicts
so i modified project file and committed("Hello from both features")
branches are merged with new project file
the merged one is feature1
as feature2 is of no use now i deleted
DONE
